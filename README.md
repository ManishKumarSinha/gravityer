Cloud Deployment
- Containerize the Application
  Create a Dockerfile for the microservice.

- Deploy the Service
  * Use AWS ECS with Fargate or GCP Cloud Run to deploy the Docker container.
  * Ensure scaling is enabled based on traffic load (ECS/GCP can auto-scale based on  CPU/Memory usage).

API Gateway
- Use Apigee or AWS API Gateway or GCP Cloud Endpoints to manage and secure the API traffic.

Observability and Monitoring
- Logging and Monitoring
  * Use AWS CloudWatch or GCP Operations to monitor application logs and set up alarms.
  * Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (/actuator/metrics, /actuator/health) provide essential metrics for monitoring.

Scaling
- Configure ECS or GCP Cloud Run to scale automatically when the service receives high traffic (10,000 requests/minute).

API Gateway and Security
- Secure the APIs
  * Use Spring Security with JWT or OAuth2 to protect the endpoints.
